The plug-in will only work with a Fleur version using xml files as I/O.  
For example check out the Fleur version released withing MAX. 

WARNING: This is a beta version, which runs, but is still under development.

Introduction <a name="Introduction"></a>
========================================

This is an AiiDA plug-in for the Fleur code.  

The Fleur plug-in consists of a datastructure called FleurinpData and two plug-ins,  
one for the Fleur inputgenerator (inpgen) and one for a Fleur calculation itself.

Every plug-in has an input part and an output parser, see the AiiDA documentation for general info.

Further there is also some useful utility found under 'aiida_fleur/tools'

Structure_util.py : constains some methods to handle AiiDA structures 
(some of them might now be methods of the AiiDA structureData, if so use them from there!)

merge_parameter.py : methods to handle parameterData nodes, i.e merge them. Which is very useful for all-electron codes, because instead of pseudo potentialsfamilies you can create now families of parameter nodes for the periodic table.

xml_util.py : all xml functions that are used, by parsers and other tools are in here. Some are 'general' some a very specific to Fleur.

read_cif.py : this can be used as stand-alone to create StructureData nodes from .cif files from an directory tree. 

Installation Instructions <a name="Installation"></a>
=====================================================

today:
The python source files of the plug-in have to be placed in the AiiDA source code in certain places. 
You might use the copy_plugin_files.sh script to do so.

in the near future:
pip install aiida_fleur

fleur calculation: aiida.orm.calculation.job.fleur_inp.fleur.py  
fleur output parser: aiida.parsers.plugins.fleur_inp.fleur.py   

The Fleur code needs a XMLSchema file, place them under, the plugin searches them in your pythonpath, it assumes also that your aiida_core code is in your pythonpath. Checkout search_path in fleurinp.py, in case need ad your path there:  
aiida.orm.calculation.job.fleur_inp.fleur_schema

Also some common routines '/aiida_fleur/tools/' used by some classes have to be placed currently under:
aiida.tools.codespecific.fleur 

Utility:

Structure_util.py
merge_parameter.py
read_cif.py
...

The plug-in source code documentation is here (will be on read_the_docs soon).  
A full documentation of the plug-in and its usage is found at www.flapw.de.   
Two usage examples are shown in 'examples'.
