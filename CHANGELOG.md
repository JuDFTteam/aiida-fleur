## v0.5.0
### Merge with advanced workflow repo
- this included the corehole and inital corehole workflow as well calculation of formation energies
  Therefore this is the first public released verison of them with in MaX
- all the utility of the corelevel repo is now under aiida_fleur/tools

- new system for the schema files, user does not has to add aiida-fleur to pythonpath or hack the schema paths.
- added new tests, submission tests and standard fleur tests
- first documention online, still very rusty still some issues there (stay with local one)

## v0.3.0

### Merge with workflows repo
- the second repository with basic workflows was merged into the plugin repostitory.
- Afterwards the repo was renamed from aiida_fleur_plugin to aiida-fleur

### Installation (new aiida plugin system):
- everything is now pip installable (pip install -e .) (not yet on pypi)
Therefore the files do not have to be copied anymore into the aiida_core source folder
(make sure to add the aiida-fleur folder to your PYTHONPATH variable)
- all modules are now importet from the aiida_fleur folder
 (example 'from aiida.tools.codespecific.fleur.convergence import fleur_convergence' -> 'from aiida_fleur.workflows.scf import fleur_scf_wc)

### Renaming
- In the process (and due to the entry points some things have to be renamed)
  The plugin in aiida (fleur_inp.fleur -> fleur.fleur; fleur_inp.fleurinp -> fleur.fleurinp; fleur_inp.fleurinputgen -> fleur.inpgen)

### Workflows
- some fine tuning of workflows. Naming scheme was introduced.
- Some first error catching and controlled shutdown (because of new AiiDA features).
- added consistent through all workflows the 'serial' key in wf_parameter nodes, which will turn of mpi.
- scf now uses minDistance and passes the walltime to fleur by default.

### Dokumentation
- Due to the new plugin system of AiiDA the Dokumentation is now online on read-the-docs.
(so far incomplete because of old AiiDA version on pypi) We still recommend to take a look at the docs in the repo itself (ggf build it)

### Utils
- read fleur cif folder does not break the proverance any more


### Further stuff
- 0.28 Fleur schema added to aiida-fleur
