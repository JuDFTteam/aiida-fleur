 Fermi energy correction for insulators:
 Fermi energy in bands.* files has been set to the maximal
 value determined in the band structure calculation and
 the calculation of the underlying density, respectively.
 
 Note: Band structure data (together with different weights) is also stored in the banddos.hdf file.
       A convenient way of extracting and plotting the data from that file is by making use of the
       masci-tools (https://pypi.org/project/masci-tools/).
 As requested by command line option usage data was not send, please send usage.json manually
