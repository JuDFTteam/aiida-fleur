Executables named 'fleur' and 'inpgen' in this dir will be used for tests. 
if they do not exist, dummy files will be created here (in the CI case for example), that tests can run with caches

if you want to test therefore with a certain fleur version copy the executable here and delete all caches, or move the cache dirs
