Here are some guidlines form writting FLEUR workflows and AiiDA in general.

general:

1. Every Workflow needs a clear documentation of input, output structures o
2. reuse as much of previous workflows as possible.
3. If you think somthing processing is common or might be useful for something else,
make it modular, and import the method
4. Try to keep the context clean

5. ggf one has to think about resource managment.
i.e if a big system needs to be calculated and the user says use x hundred cores,
and in the workflow simulations on very small systems need to be done, it makes no
sense to submit a job with the same huge amoun

Fleur Specific:

1. Output of a workflow has the nameing convention 'output_wfname_description'
   i.e 'output_scf_wf_para'
   
2. Every workflow should give back one parameter output node named 'output_wfname_para'
   which contains all the 'physical results' the workflow is designd to provide,
   or at least information to acces these results direclty (if stored in files and so on)
   further the node should contain valuable information to make sense/judge the quality of the data.
   
   Try to design this node in a way that if you take a look at it, you understand
   the following questions:
   
   which workflow was run, what version?
   what came out?  What was put in, how can I see what was put in?
   Is this valueable or garbage?
   
3. so far workflow name: fleur_name_wc
